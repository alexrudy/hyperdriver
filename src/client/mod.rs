//! HTTP client library for Rust, built on top of [hyper].
//!
//! There are three levels of available APIs in this library:
//!
//! 1. The high-level [`Client`] API, which is the most user-friendly and abstracts away most of the details.
//!    It is "batteries-included", and supports features like redirects, retries and timeouts.
//! 2. The [`Service`][ConnectionPoolService] API, which is a lower-level API that allows for more control over the request and response.
//!    It presents a `tower::Service` that can be used to send requests and receive responses, and can be wrapped
//!    by middleware compatible with the tower ecosystem.
//! 3. The [connection][self::conn] API, which is the lowest-level API that allows for direct control over the
//!    transport and protocol layers. This API is useful for implementing custom transports or protocols, but
//!    might be difficult to directly use as a client.
//!
